Protect our ecosystem by finding and removing invasive species!

## Running the App
In the main directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then `npm start` to run the backend. In another terminal window, navigate to the 'client' directory and run the same two commands to run the frontend.

## Structure
This project consists of two apps: a React frontend (called "client"), and a Node/Express backend.
